Das is gut!

This is my first atempt to build a train model with a deep neural network.I'm very excited,and I want to go further to 
more complex models such as LSTM or RNN, for training generative model chatbots,or reproducing art paintings.

In this example I feed the deep neural network with the weel known iris flower dataset from scikit-learn framework, and used
tensorflow for training the model and predict if a given input represents an iris or not.

Ok,so the training dataset is represented by 120 rows and 5 columns representing:

Sepal length  	Sepal width 	Petal length  	Petal width 	Species
    5.1	            3.5	          1.4	            0.2	      I. setosa
    4.9	            3.0	          1.4	            0.2	      I. setosa
    4.7	            3.2	          1.3	            0.2	      I. setosa
    4.6	            3.1	          1.5	            0.2	      I. setosa
...
     Ref:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set
     
     
Neural networks are very good at predicting and finding patterns,and with the training dataset above it will "guess" wich kind
of iris flower the characteristics sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width corespond to.To note that the model will
always predict an iris flower,even if the input characteristics will be ridiculously different such as 100.1   300.5   234.6   432.9

The model is a deep neural network, with 3 layers,each layer having 10, 20, respectively 10 neurons.For simplicity I used 
DNNClassifier from skflow,but for much deeper studying I recomend "http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com".It's a great
starting place for understanding this babes.Yes,neural networks are hot and sexy :P

A testing dataset is given for prediction accuracy.Obviously this dataset is much smaller,but it will say how well the model is "guessing".
On my computer the accuracy is 0.805556,prety well I say,but for better acuracy it will need a bigger training model and bigger neural
network.That implies more computation power.

In the end I tested the model with 2 arrays and voila I have my own iris flower detector.
